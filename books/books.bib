@BOOK{Allen1987,
  title = {War Games: The Secret World of the Creators, Players, and Policy Makers Rehearsing World War III Today},
  publisher = {McGraw-Hill},
  year = {1987},
  author = {Thomas B. Allen},
  abstract = {I found this book in the bibliography of "Out of
	 Control". It is an in-depth history and insider's view of the large-scale
	 simulations which the U.S. military agencies run to decipher the
	 life-and-depth complexity of war. I have found the material to be a little
	 dated, and there are certain passages that are repetative and boring.
	 But every time I get ready to drop the book for good, Allen throws
	 down a interesting historical tidbit to keep me hooked. Like the
	 fact that the selective service registration comes directly from a
	 mobilization and readiness war game played in 1978, known as "Nifty Nugget".},

@BOOK{Dennett1992,
  title = {Consciousness Explained},
  publisher = {Back Bay Books},
  year = {1992},
  author = {Daniel Dennett},
  abstract = {My buddy <a href="rejectedbanana-300.jpg">Nate</a> tells me I need to read this book. Here's what Publisher's
	 Weekly had to say: "Tufts University cognitive scientist Dennett
	 claims to have developed a major new theory of consciousness, yet
	 his view of the brain as a massive parallel processor is a familiar
	 one. What is different in his counter-intuitive theory is the claim
	 that human consciousness, rather than being "hard-wired" into the
	 brain's innate machinery, is more like software "running on the brain's
	 parallel hardware" and is largely a product of cultural evolution.
	 Author of Brainstorms , Dennett leads the adventurous gently through
	 thought experiments, metaphors and diagrams in a treatise keyed to
	 the serious, diligent reader. He presents a plausible evolutionary
	 scenario of how consciousness could have emerged from the hominid
	 brain. Dennett's audacious, tantalizing foray into the mind's inner
	 workings ties up loose ends at the interface of cognitive psychology,
	 artificial intelligence, neuroscience and biology." (from Amazon.com)},

@BOOK{Gamma1995,
  title = {Design Patterns : Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software},
  publisher = {Addison-Wesley Professional},
  year = {1995},
  author = {Erich Gamma and Richard Helm and Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides},
  abstract = {It is time for me to geek out about how
	 this book is amazing. It is a true compendium of design patterns in
	 software engineering. Most computer scientists encounter the very
	 basics of pattern design in their studies. But if you really want
	 to find out what you are missing, pick up this book. If the words
	 Abstract Factory, Singleton, Flyweight, Memento, or Adapter make you
	 drool, you need to read this book. Very early in the book, the authors
	 pay homage to the work of Christopher Alexander and his "A Pattern
	 Language" series. Those books provide some neat insight into how
	 patterns are designed. The only drawback to the series is that I
	 repeatedly was asking the question, "this is interesting, but how does it
	 apply to my work." Which is why you need to read Design Patterns.},

	 charts, Douglas R. Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden
	 Braid is still something of a marvel. Besides being a profound and
	 entertaining meditation on human thought and creativity, this book looks
	 at the surprising points of contact between the music of Bach, the
	 artwork of Escher, and the mathematics of Gödel. It also looks at
	 the prospects for computers and artificial intelligence (AI) for
	 mimicking human thought. For the general reader and the computer techie
	 alike, this book still sets a standard for thinking about the future
	 of computers and their relation to the way we think." (Amazon.com)},

	 simulation of our planet. "Kevin Kelly's wonderfully perceptive new book
	 shatters more paradigms per page than any other text in this decade. Out

	 to write [Out of Control]." Marvin Minsky, one of the undisputed
	 fathers of the discipline of AI, sets out to provide an abstract model
	 of how the human mind really works. His thesis is that our minds
	 consist of a huge aggregation of tiny mini-minds or agents that have
	 evolved to perform highly specific tasks. Most of these agents lack the
	 attributes we think of as intelligence and are severely limited in
	 their ability to intercommunicate. Yet rational thought, feeling, and
	 purposeful action result from the interaction of these basic components.},

@BOOK{Powers1992,
  title = {Gold Bug Variations},
  publisher = {Perennial Books},
  year = {1992},
  author = {Richard Powers},
  abstract = {Yet another book that I read a while ago, and forgot how it was amazing. The
	 is really the fiction equivalent of GED, and I mean the real deal.
	 I'm going to have to quote the Publishers Weekly blurb in full. It
	 seems impossible that a beautiful work of fiction covers all of the
	 following topics, but it is all there.<p> "[T]his strange, overwritten,
	 often infuriating, manically intelligent and sometimes deeply moving
	 novel could hardly have been produced by a writer of mere talent.
	 Powers has woven an extraordinary knowledge of music, of science
	 (particularly of the search for genetic coding, and of computer programming),
	 of the mysteries of language and art history, into a saga that is
	 dazzling and wearying in almost equal measure. The novel jumps back
	 and forth between the late '50s, when brilliant scientist Stuart
	 Ressler is involved with an Illinois research team trying to break the
	 mysteries of DNA coding, and the '80s, when librarian Jan O'Deigh and
	 computer programmer Franklin Todd get to know Ressler, now holding an
	 insignificant night job at a massive computer database operation
	 in Brooklyn, N.Y., and try to figure what derailed his promising
	 career. Not a great deal happens, in a conventional narrative sense.
	 Ressler has an affair with one married fellow scientist and learns
	 music from another; his scientific career is, in fact, aborted by his
	 resulting passion for music. O'Deigh leaves her glib Madison Avenue
	 boyfriend, takes up with Todd and is then abandoned by him in his vain
	 search for information about an obscure 16th-century Flemish artist.
	 Toward the end the three principals are involved in a massive computer
	 scam to help a stricken colleague. Despite occasional bewilderment
	 at arid patches of scientific jargon and interminable displays of
	 arcane knowledge for its own sake, a reader persists with The Gold Bug
	 Variations (the title, obviously, is a play on Bach's Goldberg Variations
	 , which have a key role in the book's intellectual structure, and
	 Edgar Allan Poe's The Gold Bug , about the solving of a puzzle). For
	 there is a perpetual air of surprise about the book, of intellectual
	 excitement, a passionate involvement with words that expands into
	 delightfully witty dialogue and profoundly evocative description. Reading
	 it is hard work, but it's also deeply enriching; the decade is not
	 likely to bring another novel half as challenging and original."},

	 journey of the mind--that goes deeply into the problem of self and

	 mesmerizing, maze-like fiction of Borges to the tantalizing, dreamlike
	 fiction of Lem and Princess Ineffable, her circuits glowing read and
