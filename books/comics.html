		DC's Vertigo line was launched with the intention of bringing a line of titles to grown-ups who still wanted to read comics. The books were a departure from the spandex world of Batman and Superman, instead exploring magic, fantasy, and horror. One of the first books in the line, Neil Gaiman's Sandman, was perhaps completely representative of the line, exploring all of the above-mentioned areas and more, all the while keeping a toe in the mainstream DC Universe, allowing long-time comic readers a reference point for the series. <p>Sandman was launched in 1988, and nearly immediately garnered critical praise, followed soon by a fairly large fan base. The seventy-five issue series focused on the Endless, a group of seven entities that oversees such realms as Desire, Delirium, Death, Destiny, and most notably, Dream... What truly makes the series special, though, is Gaiman's gift as a storyteller. The series at times reads like one of the Canterbury Tales, at others like a Shakespearean play, at others like a classic of the future. Always, though, the characters are compelling, the plots complex, and the dialogue real and believable. --RevolutionSF webzine

The Dark Knight Returns is a superhero comic book story published by DC Comics between 1985 and 1986, starring Batman. The story's creator, Frank Miller, sought to create a fitting "end" for the character of Batman: just as the Norse myths had their Ragnarok, so would Batman meet his end at some tragic moment in the near future. <P>The book is set in a dark, depressing world of the future where criminals run amok, and Batman's home of Gotham City is being terrorized by a gang of murderers called The Mutants. Bruce Wayne (Batman) is approaching sixty years old, and he gave up the role of Batman ten years before the story begins. But he reaches a point in his life where he cannot sit back and watch the world be overrun by thieves and murderers, and so he dons the mantle of the Caped Crusader one last time and embarks on a final battle against the world. <P>Upon its publication, The Dark Knight Returns turned the comic book industry on its ear. It helped to introduce an era of more adult-oriented storytelling to the mainstream world of superhero comic books, and it received media attention the likes of which had never seen before in a medium long believed to be little more than children's entertainment. --wikipedia

		[Compiler's comment: The graphic novel's equivalent of "I Hate the 80s, Part II". --Spiegel]<P> It may seem hard to imagine today, but back in 1985, nobody was particularly familiar with the idea of superheroes with human emotions, psychological problems, or anything other than square jaws and simple morals. Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's Watchmen helped change all that. It's a story about ordinary people who, by design or accident, decide to wear costumes and fight crime. The resulting alternate future turns the superhero genre on its head, questioning the validity of caped crusaders in a realistic world spanning 50 years. <P>Watchmen is an extraordinary piece of work. It is designed to be read at least twice - there's no way you could get the most out of this in one reading, as so much is built up before we have a chance of noticing it. On first read, you may find yourself smacked in the face by an awesome ending. Second time through, you'll wonder how you could have missed all those clues. <P>Every cut in the action is linked to the next scene, often with overlapping dialogue and meaning. Symbols, from pyramids to the famously defaced smiley, pervade the artwork, providing visual references to the story's themes. Images as simple and everyday as falling objects are laden with depths of meaning by a process of association and repetition, so that reading the book and piecing everything together is a blatant intellectual challenge to the reader. Pulling together the strands of the book as you read through is as satisfying as completing the last clue in a crossword or placing the final piece in a jigsaw puzzle. --www.grovel.org.uk

The series is set in a future Britain where, in the chaos following a limited nuclear war that left the country mostly physically intact, a fascist one-party state has arisen. It resembles the Nazi regime?including government-controlled media, secret police, and concentration camps for racial and sexual minorities?but with a British cultural flavor, and a greater reliance on technology, especially closed-circuit television monitoring in the mode of George Orwell's 1984. (CCTV had not yet become common in England at the time Moore wrote the series.) When the series begins, political conflict has ended, the death camps have finished their work and been closed, and the public is largely complacent, until "V"?a terrorist and self-proclaimed anarchist, who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and has an improbable array of abilities and resources?begins an elaborate, violent, and theatrical campaign to bring down the government. <P> The series was Moore's first use of the densely detailed narrative and multiple plot lines that would feature heavily in Watchmen. The backgrounds of panels are often crammed with clues and red herrings; literary allusions and wordplay are prominent in the chapter titles and in V's speech (which also often takes the form of iambic pentameter). --wikipedia
