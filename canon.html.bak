    <h1>A Computer Science Canon</h1>
    <p><blockquote>&#147;The classics are those books about which you usually hear people saying: &#145;I&#146;m rereading...&#146;, never &#145;I&#146;m reading...&#146;&#148;</i> &#151; Italo Calvino, <i>Why read the classics?</i> Italian publishing 1991, translated 1999.</blockquote>

	<td>These writings comprise my list of the classics in computer science. The list is unabashedly biased and subjective.  While I have included several historical works, many of the contemporary works have been selected on the basis of personal interest. For a more comprehensive look at the historical works, I strongly recommend <a href="http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/~ctg/pubs/sigcsecanon.pdf">"Creating a computer science canon: A course of classic readings in computer science"</a> by Michael Eisenberg at the University of Colorado. My purpose of creating such a list is twofold; to enumerate those works that have profoundly shaped the computer science community, and to list those works that have influenced my own research and education. The list below strikes a balance of these two interests. Suggestions, criticisms, or comments are always appreciated.
