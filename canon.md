## A Computer Science Canon

> "The classics are those books about which you usually hear people saying:
> 'I'm rereading...', never 'I'm reading...'" -- Italo Calvino, _Why read the
> classics?_ Italian publishing 1991, translated 1999.

These writings comprise my list of the classics in computer science. In
recognition of the inevitable for all efforts of this nature, the list below is
biased and subjective.  While I have included several historical works, many of
the contemporary works have been selected on the basis of personal interest. For
a more comprehensive look at the historical works, I strongly recommend
[Creating a computer science canon: A course of classic readings in computer
science](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.84.1164) by Michael
Eisenberg at the University of Colorado. My purpose of creating such a list is
twofold; to enumerate those works that have profoundly shaped the computer
science community, and to list those works that have influenced my own research
and education. The list below strikes a balance of these two interests.
Suggestions, criticisms, or comments are always appreciated.
