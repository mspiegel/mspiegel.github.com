Doc Renaissance Computing Institute (2011-present).
 Chapel Hill, NC.
 An interdisciplinary position sponsored by the high performance computing
 and bioinformatics groups.
 The objective is the application of doctoral experience on concurrent algorithm
s and data structures to high performance, high throughput analysis of genetic
 information.
 Involved in the implementation of an efficient hierarchical OpenMP runtime,
 an extension of the Qthreads library (
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

www.cs.sandia.gov/qthreads
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 My contribution is the design and implementation of an array-based lock-free
 dequeue that supports concurrent modification on both ends of the data
 structure.
 Experience with reasoning about the x86 memory model and atomic operations.
 Also involved in the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by NextGen
 Exome Sequencing project.
 I am involved in the effort to transform the genomic statistical inference
 algorithms that are typically applied across 100 kilobase pair regions
 into efficient implementations that process all 3.2 billion base pairs of
 the human genome.

Student Modeling and Simulation Laboratory (2006-2011).
 Charlottesville, VA.
 My doctoral research explored novel lock-free cache-conscious data structures,
 namely lock-free data structures that maintain the abstraction of a linearizabl
e ordered set.
 I created the dense skip tree as a variation of the skip tree data structure,
 and proved cache-conscious properties of the dense skip tree.
 The lock-free dense skip tree has relaxed structural properties that allow
 atomic operations to modify the tree without invalidating the consistency
 of the data structure.

 I show that cache-conscious, linearizable concurrent data structures have
 advantageous performance that can be measured across multiple architecture
 platforms on both synthetic and application benchmarks.
 Experience with reasoning about the Java virtual machine memory model and
 atomic operations.

Student Modeling and Simulation Laboratory (2004-2006).
 Charlottesville, VA.
 My master's research studied the role model context plays in simulation
 composability and reusability.
 I performed a case study in which participants attempted to identify all
 validation constraints for a relatively simple model.
 For a simple problem: compute the position and velocity of a falling body,
 we found that no single study participant was capable of identifying more
 than three-quarters of all identified constraints.
 Experience with Modeling and Simulation concepts, including composability,
 reusability, interoperability, verification and validation, agent-based
 modeling, quantifying uncertainty, DIS, and HLA (refer to section 3: Teaching
 Experience).

Developer Human Dynamics Laboratory (2008-2011).
 Charlottesville, VA.
 Founding participant in the design and development of the OpenMx library.
 OpenMx is free and open source software for use with R that allows estimation
 of a wide variety of advanced multivariate statistical models.
 The OpenMx website receives approximately 400 download requests per month.
 My areas of responsibility include the OpenMx library API, the implementation
 of the front end (transform the model into an intermediate representation),
 the implementation of the parallel back end (a numerical optimizer), the
 unit testing framework, and the performance testing framework.
 The OpenMx website is

Intern Sun Microsystems (2008).
 Burlington, MA.
 Worked on the Fortress language implementation.
 Performed concurrent maintenance of the Fortress interpreter while designing
 a compiler to target Java bytecode instructions.
 Fortress is a novel programming language designed for high-performance
 computing with high programmability.
 Fortress is an open-source project sponsored by the programming languages
 research group at Sun laboratories.
 Additionally I wrote a performance testing framework to work with the automated
 build system, such that code contributions can be assessed on multiple
 performance metrics.

 in Boulder, CO.
 This five day workshop covers topics including causes of variation; univariate
 twin analysis; between group heterogeneity; path analysis; analysis of
 raw data; multivariate genetic analysis; and an introduction to quantitative
 trait loci and association.

 Team-taught Advanced Modeling and Simulation with my research advisor as
 an undergraduate seminar for upper-level students.
 The course is designed to expose students to the existing capabilities,
 challenges, and limitations of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) technology.
 I prepared reading material and class discussion for topics on modeling
 and simulation in public policy, such as model uncertainty, epidemic prediction
, long-term nuclear waste storage, weather prediction and climate modeling.
