\begin_layout Topic
\labelwidthstring MMMMM
Summer\InsetSpace ~
Intern Sun Microsystems (2008) Burlington, MA.
 Worked on the Fortress language implementation.
 Performed concurrent maintenance of the Fortress interpreter while designing
 a compiler to target Java bytecode instructions.
 Fortress is a novel programming language designed for high-performance
 computing with high programmability.
 Fortress is an open-source project sponsored by the programming languages
 research group at Sun laboratories.
 Additionally I wrote a performance testing framework to work with the automated
 build system, such that code contributions can be assessed on multiple
 performance metrics.

y organize and manage audio/video content.
 Combined research tools in the areas of computational linguistics, artificial
 intelligence, machine learning, and speech recognition for English/Spanish
 and English/Arabic translation systems.
 StreamSage was founded in 2000 as a privately owned, small business.
 The company was acquired by Comcast Corporation in 2005.

Research\InsetSpace ~
Assistant Cluster computing lab.
 (2002-2003) Swarthmore College, Department of Computer Science.
 Development of a linux loadable kernel module that utilizes idle RAM of
 the cluster as swap space for memory-saturated nodes of the cluster.
 The module employs a client/server architecture.
 The client is implemented as a virtual block device, which is employed
 as the swap device.
 I implemented the device driver code of the client, and the dynamic growing/shr
inking of the server.
 Learned linux kernel development practices, including the KDB built-in
 kernel debugger.
 Gained familiarization of the kernel, particularly the driver code and
 linux 2.4 memory management subsystems.
 This project served as the basis of my undergraduate Honors thesis.

\begin_layout Topic
\labelwidthstring MMMMM
CS451 University of Virginia.
 Team-taught undergraduate seminar with my research adviser.
 CS451: Advanced Modeling and Simulation.
 CS451 was designed by Paul Reynolds and myself to expose students to the
 existing capabilities, challenges, and limitations of Modeling and Simulation
 (M&S) technology.
 One of the teaching goals was to expose students to current applications
 of modeling and simulation in public policy.
 Topics included epidemic prediction, long-term nuclear waste storage, and
 global warming.
 I researched the reading material and prepared class discussion for approximate
ly 1/2 of the course content.
 The class notes are available online at www.cs.virginia.edu/wiki/simulation.
